# React Test: Simple Perswonal Blog

**Challenge**: This test asks the candidate to build a single-page application (SPA) for a simple personal blog. The goal is to test their understanding of JavaScript, React, CSS frameworks (specifically responsiveness/mobile-friendliness), Git version control, and their ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

The [following Figma layout needs to be developed](https://www.figma.com/file/Lpk703811Gv3PNmn2ydlGP/Free-Blog-Template--%7C-Modern-%26-Creative-design-(Community)?type=design&mode=design).

It's important to say that it is just a prototype! We would also like to see your ability to propose improvements, features and new contributions to the product's UI ðŸ˜„! Use the layout only as reference!

## Tech Requirements

- Use React JS as the primary framework.
- Choose a modern CSS framework like Material UI or Chakra UI for responsive design and mobile-friendliness.
- Utilize Git for version control throughout the development process.
- Focus on writing clean, well-organized, and commented code.
- Follow best practices for unit testing and code documentation.

## Assessment Criteria:

### Functionality:
- Completeness and accuracy of implemented features.
- User-friendliness and intuitive UX/UI design.
### Technical Depth:
- Use of appropriate React patterns and components.
- Effective state management and data handling.
- Implementation of responsive design and mobile-friendliness.
- Utilization of Git for version control and collaboration.
### Code Quality:
- Readability, maintainability, and clarity of code.
- Effective use of comments and documentation.
- Adherence to best practices for code structure and indentation.
### Bonus Points:
- Create your own mock-up API from the other [challenge] (https://github.com/GapaiID/SE-challenge4) to fetch the data.
- Implementation of mobile responsive design.
- Implementation of additional features beyond the basic requirements.
- Creative and innovative solutions to technical challenges.
- Deploy your work to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, docker) and share your link through the email.
