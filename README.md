# React Test: Interactive Recipe Book

**Challenge**: This test asks the candidate to build a single-page application (SPA) for an interactive recipe book. The goal is to test their understanding of JavaScript, React, CSS frameworks (specifically responsiveness/mobile-friendliness), Git version control, and their ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Features:

### Recipe List:
  - Display a list of recipes with title, image, and key ingredients.
  - Allow filtering recipes by category (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert).
  - Enable searching for recipes by name or ingredient.
### Recipe Details:
  - On clicking a recipe, open a detailed view with full instructions, ingredients list with quantities, and cooking time.
  - Allow users to mark ingredients as "added" to facilitate shopping list creation.
  - Provide an option to scale the recipe for different portions.
### Additional Functionality:
  - Implement pagination for the recipe list (optional).
  - Enable users to add their own recipes (bonus points).
  - Integrate a timer functionality for cooking (bonus points).

## Tech Requirements

- Use React.
- Choose a modern CSS framework like Material UI or Chakra UI for responsive design and mobile-friendliness.
- Utilize Git for version control throughout the development process.
- Focus on writing clean, well-organized, and commented code.
- Follow best practices for unit testing and code documentation.

## Assessment Criteria:

### Functionality:
- Completeness and accuracy of implemented features.
- User-friendliness and intuitive UX/UI design.
### Technical Depth:
- Use of appropriate React patterns and components.
- Effective state management and data handling.
- Implementation of responsive design and mobile-friendliness.
- Utilization of Git for version control and collaboration.
### Code Quality:
- Readability, maintainability, and clarity of code.
- Effective use of comments and documentation.
- Adherence to best practices for code structure and indentation.
### Bonus Points:
- Create your own mock-up API to fetch the data.
- Implementation of mobile responsive design.
- Implementation of additional features beyond the basic requirements.
- Creative and innovative solutions to technical challenges.
- Deploy your work to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, docker) and share your link through the email.
